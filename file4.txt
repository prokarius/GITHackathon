3. Autonomous Vehicle Networks 
Driving the Car from a Consumer Product to a Network 


We 
believe the 
looming era of driverless 
cars will transition the ‘car’ 
from 
a 
consumer product towards 
more of a network 
— 
a network you can access on-
demand or as a subscriber. 
To be sure, this disruption won’t necessarily 
affect every 
type of car (pickups 
and 
large 
vans 
are 
less 
affected) or every region (rural 
and 
snowier regions 
are 
less 
affected), but it will 
likely redefine large parts of the 
automotive 
market, 
as well 
as 
related non-automotive verticals. 


When thinking about innovations such as 
artificial intelligence (AI), connectivity, 
electrification, big data, 
etc., 
there is perhaps no more obvious use case than the 
Car of Today. Today’s cars 
— 
as advanced as they’ve 
become 
— 
still operate well 
below 
their full potential. Consider the significant cost and societal implications 
incurred from 
cars not being 
as safe as they can be, not monetizing 
data the way 
they theoretically can, 
and not 
being utilized 
as 
efficiently as they can. 
The age of 
mass-market personal 
cars solved many problems of the past, but also created new 
ones 
— 
congestion and pollution being 
particularly notable. And vehicle 
safety, 
while vastly improved, remains a substantial 
societal and economic problem that’s 
unfortunately 
hasn’t gotten 
easier in the age of distracted driving. The Car of the 
Future 
— 
which combines advancements 
in 
AI, connectivity, computing power, and 
electrification 
— 
not only 
promises to 
address many of these 
problems, but will also 
potentially change 
personal mobility as we know it. 
The tipping point for all of this 
will be the entry of the driverless 
car 
(autonomous vehicle 
— 
AV). Unlike semi-
autonomous vehicles (i.e., 
level-2, or level-3), a fullAV is a vehicle 
capable of 
operating without a 
human driver inside 
the vehicle. 

At the end of this transformation, we think the 
auto market will be 
characterized by: 

1. RoboTaxi driverless 
car services (mobility-on-demand, or rideshares) operating 
mainly in urban and some 
urban/suburban 
markets. These are dedicated fleets 
similar to Uber today 
but utilizing driverless cars. 
2. AV Subscriptions, i.e., driverless-capable 
cars that one 
subscribes 
to combining 
the best attributes of personal 
ownership with the benefits 
of AVs, 
3. Traditional 
ownership in certain segments 
and 
regions (pickups, commercial 
vehicles). 
These 
traditionally-owned vehicles 
can 
still have 
AV features 
sold as 
standalone options, 
even if they are 
‘off the network.’ 
Electric vehicles (EVs) will be 
a critical 
competitive input in all three of these mobility 
options, since EVs 
can reduce the 
cost of ownership while addressing tailpipe 
emissions in 
urban regions (particularly important, in 
our view, for the RoboTaxi 
vertical). 

We 
see this occurring 
in a number of stages: 

• 
Stage 1 (2018+) 
-RoboTaxi AV as a 
Network (urban/suburban): 
A ‘RoboTaxi’ 
can 
be defined as a 
fleet of driverless vehicles operating rideshare (taxi) services 
in a 
particular area, mainly cities and surrounding suburbs. We 
expect RoboTaxis 
to begin U.S. commercialization in 
2018–19, 
led by 
Waymo 
and 
GM. The race to 
launch and 
commercialize RoboTaxis is all about building a 
powerful network 
effect. 
This network effect is determined by who can 
introduce and 
effectively 
scale 
safe, reliable, fast, 
and low-cost urban RoboTaxiAV fleets.

Full highway autonomy will likely be 
available as an option on cars by 2020–21 

By the mid-2020s, we believe AVs will 
expand into personally-owned vehicles 

Here’s an example: Suppose 
a RoboTaxiAV fleet launches 
with greater human 
safety in a 
major city. The absence of driver costs allows that AV fleet to offer a 
significant price discount to consumers (~40%) vs. conventional rideshare/taxis, 
while still operating 
at unit profitability or at least breakeven. Let’s also assume 
the 
AV is purpose-built to include four compartments for passengers and a few 
compartments for deliveries. The demand generated by this 
newAV fleet (initially 
drawing demand because 
it’s 
cheaper) allows the vehicles to (1) gain further 
data/driving 
experience, 
thereby presumably making the fleet safer and 
faster 
(more 
human-like) through rapid learnings, 
and (2) pool people 
and 
things in 
safe/private 
compartments 
to 
generate a higher load-factor that reduces the price 
per mile 
for consumers. If we assume that this fleet has a one-year head start 
versus 
the next competitor, this lead fleet can essentially become 
safer, faster, 
and 
cheaper than 
its 
late-arriving competitor. And if we assume the fleet started 
scaling in 
a complex domain (major city, many routes) and 
operating at unit 
profitability, then scaling to additional 
cities can occur faster than had the fleet 
started operating 
somewhere less 
challenging or less 
dense. 
To that, theAV 
RoboTaxi model 
is 
expected to commence 
in 
urban areas for a few reasons— 
urban 
density yields respectable unit economics on 
initially very costly vehicles 
(allowing 
companies to 
scale 
up), a low-speed 
environment enables relatively 
safer deployment, 
and 
cities 
are ideal grounds to improve 
upon congestion 
and 
pollution challenges (we think 
EVs are 
clearly advantaged in 
the RoboTaxi race). 
We’ve previously estimated the U.S. urban/suburban RoboTaxi revenue 
total 
addressable market (TAM) 
to 
be 
~$900 
billion. Key U.S. 
players in this race 
include 
Waymo, GM, and Uber. And as noted, the stakes go far beyond the 
~$900 
billion 
revenue pool 
— 
the network 
effect described 
above could lead 
to a 
few regional winners-take-all outcomes. 

• 
Stage 2 (2021+) 
-AV Standalone Features (highway first): 
Around 2020–21, 
we expect to 
see 
more 
AV (level 3+) 
driving features sold 
as 
options 
similar to 
how many options are 
sold today in cars (including through greater use 
of over-
the-air (OTA) 
updates). Full highway autonomy will likely prove to be 
a popular 
and reasonably affordable feature 
— 
highways tend to be somewhat less 
complex than urban 
centers, and who wouldn’t want to let the car drive while 
stuck in traffic? Features 
like this 
exist today at a level-2+ and level-3 
basis 
(Nissan ProPilot, GM SuperCruise, Tesla 
Autopilot, Audi 
Traffic Jam 
Assist), but 
upgrades 
to level-4 
are expected around 
2021. 
• 
Stage 3 (2023+): 
AV Subscription Networks (Level 4+): 
The third stage comes 
around the mid-2020s 
and 
entails expandingAVs into personally-owned vehicles 
that consumers 
can purchase, but perhaps 
more 
compellingly, subscribe to. 
The 
biggest gating factor for personal 
AVs (relative to 
urban RoboTaxis) is 
AV cost 
optimization and robust crowdsource 
mapping, in 
our view. A common 
misconception we hear about personalAVs is that they’ll need to be 
‘level-5’AVs 
that can 
operate anywhere/everywhere. We don’t view it this way. We see plenty 
of compelling 
level-4 applications, 
even at the personalAV level. One such 
example is a human-lessAV that’s allowed to 
operate 
in driverless-mode 
only in 
middle-of-night with no humans, only at reasonably low 
speeds, 
and perhaps 
initially on specific routes. This effective 
‘level-4+’ 
domain, in 
our view, would be 
sufficient to unlock 
new 
and 
powerful models 
— 
includingAV Subscriptions and a 
related subset in peer-to-peer sharing. An 
AV Subscription would 
be an 
effectively leasedAV combining the 
benefits of ownership (instant access to a 
car) with sharing optionality (peer-to-peer) and 
swapping, as 
well as an arguably 
far better ‘ownership’ 
experience by having 
service done autonomously at 2am.

AV Subscription networks for personal AVs 
should have a simplified payment structure, 
plus benefits like autonomous service, 
vehicle swapper, and liquid peer-to-peer 
loans 

Benefits from EVs, AVs, and the network 
effect unlock a significant cost-of-ownership 
tailwind throughout the life of the vehicle 

So in addition to traditional 
car ownership 
and 
leasing, automakers would createAV 
Subscription 
networks 
for personal 
AVs available for sale. Let’s 
assume this vehicle 
is an EV and that EVs have 
more/less reached cost parity with ICE 
vehicles. Let’s 
also assume that the 
cost of the 
AV technology comes down to a reasonable $6,000 


— 
a figure we think is reasonable based on supplier commentary. A consumer 
considering a purchase of vehicle XYZ would be 
offered 
a subscription to that 
vehicle’s EV/AV trim level. Subscribing to that EV/AV would 
provide the 
consumer 
with several benefits: 
• 
Payment Structure: 
A simplified monthly payment providing 
a flat fee 
to 
cover 
the vehicle, insurance, fuel (electricity), and 
maintenance. 
• 
Benefits: 
Besides enjoyingAV 
features while using 
them 
in the car (highway 
automation), the 
subscriber would 
also enjoyAV-related 
benefits such 
as the 
car 
going in 
for service (or a car wash) in the middle of the night. Or the car dropping 
you off and 
picking you 
up later to save on 
parking 
expenses. Or a car going to 
pick up merchandise from 
a store/mall 
near you in 
the 
middle of the night (lastmile 
delivery). 
• 
Vehicle swapping: 
Network subscribers would 
have the option to 
swap their 
vehicles for another vehicle 
in 
the network. To ensure constant availability of 
vehicles, the 
network (OEM) would 
always have a 
small 
fleet of extra vehicles 
available at dealer lots 
— 
an assortment of leisure 
and 
utility 
vehicles that might 
fit a 
consumer’s occasional 
need/want. 
This would be 
an added network 
convenience feature. 
• 
Liquid peer-to-peer: 
Peer-to-peer would 
allow owners ofAV-equipped vehicles 
to 
loan out their vehicles to peers in exchange for a fee, with 
the transfer of the 
vehicle occurring 
in the 
middle of the night with no humans in the 
car. We think 
Tesla’s 
planned 
Tesla Network might end up becoming a peer-to-peer network. 
So let’s say you’re not planning on using your car tomorrow; at 2am the car can 
drive itself to the renter and 
come back to you the 
next night at 2am. Peer-topeer 
might also 
entail 
lending 
your vehicle to that network’s 
RoboTaxi fleet (if one 
exists), thereby making that RoboTaxi fleet asset-light while 
creating 
more 
liquidity for the subscribers of the 
AV network. So if the network already has a 
scaled RoboTaxi business, that extra liquidity might be 
advantageous to 
prospective customers 
considering 
an 
AV Subscription. It’s important to always 
note that swapping vehicles would 
be entirely optional for the subscribers. If you 
want to have your car for the entire 
subscription and never swap/share, that’s 
fine. 
Subscriptions could be 
tiered 
based on luxury/mass segments as well as vehicle 
age. For example, a Platinum 
subscription would always ensure subscribers receive 
vehicles that are 0–4 years old, Gold would 
ensure 4–8 
years, Silver 8–12 
years, 
and 
so on. For each tier, a new fleet of vehicles would 
arrive every ~4 years. For 
many, this would eliminate the 
anxiety of monitoring their car’s residual value as a 
funding 
source for their next car. Every ~4 years you get access to an 
incoming 
fleet. 


Based 
on the economics of this model, we estimate that the 
consumer could end up 
paying the 
same or even a bit less (per month) than 
with 
a 
non-AV vehicle. That’s 
because the 
benefits of EVs, AVs, 
and the 
network 
effect promise to 
unlock a 
significant cost-of-ownership tailwind throughout the 
life of the vehicle.

Automakers could structure monthly 
payments that capture the economics of 
vehicle maintenance, lower insurance costs, 
and much safer AVs 

For instance, by taking control 
of the vehicle throughout its life, the 
automaker 
(network) could 
structure a 
compelling monthly payment for consumers 
by capturing 
the economics of vehicle maintenance that isn’t presently captured 
by the 
automaker today, while realizing 
lower insurance costs from 
much-safer AVs. Some 
of those 
savings 
could be passed 
on to consumers as part of the 
monthly 
subscription cost. 

By 
way of brief summary, here’s how we’ve previously 
modeled it: 


• 
Assume the network sets 
its 
monthly payments (revenue) at the cost-ofownership 
for a 
conventional 
car. For conservatism, we did 
not include parking 
costs as a 
component of vehicle cost of ownership, nor did we assume any 
revenue priced-in from optional peer-to-peer sharing fees. 
• 
We 
assumed 
the EV/AV vehicle comes at a $6,000 
added variable cost versus 
the conventional car 
— 
again, 
we’re talking 
about 2023–25+ so by then the 
industry benefits from lower-cost sensors (LiDAR), learnings from 
AV 
developments (including RoboTaxi players), 
and 
next-gen 
cameras 
and 
radars 
(higher resolution/range) 
should be evident. We view this 
as 
reasonable based 
on supplier commentary around future level-4+ costs. 
• 
The network, in 
this case an 
automaker, sells the vehicle 
to 
a FinCo and leases 
the vehicle back. We 
impute the leasing cost of the vehicle over the 
15-year 
life 
at a $0 salvage value 
with an interest rate 
of 3% and a vehicle price of $41,000, 
which takes the $35,000 
price 
imputed 
above and adds $6,000 
of AV content. 
• 
EV range 
at 300 
miles on a 
70kWh battery at 
$0.12 
electricity cost. 
• 
Insurance savings = 40% versus 
a 
conventional vehicle thanks to theAV sensor 
suite’s 
performing highly-advanced 
advanced 
driver-assistance systems (ADAS) 
at all times. 
• 
Maintenance costs savings =35% due to 
lack of aftermarket 
mark-ups and 
presumably lower lifetime maintenance cost of an EV. 
That being 
said, in year-9 
we did assume that the network replaces the EV battery.

Based on our modelling, we estimate a fleet 
of 100,000 AV Subscribers can earn $2.5 
billion of lifetime gross profit 

EV’s 
have 
had 
market 
focus of late, but the 
emphasis on AV Networks is increasing 

We think market observers are still painting 
with a broad industry brush and instead 
should look at individual vehicle segments 
and regions 

Looking at AV Subscription as a component 
of the long-term opportunity is key 

Total addressable U.S. RoboTaxi revenue 
market is estimated at $900 billion 

A fleet of 100,000 AV Subscribers can earn 
$2.5 billion of lifetime gross profit 

Based 
on the above, we roughly estimate a fleet of 100,000AV Subscribers 
can 
earn $2.5 
billion of lifetime gross profit. This would be 
in 
addition to an estimated 
~$900 
billion RoboTaxi U.S.-revenue 
total addressable market. More importantly, 
given the sizable 
safety, economic, 
and convenience benefits that such networks 
could offer consumers, we 
could 
see 
a very rapid 
acceleration of level-4+ AV vehicle 
penetration. 

How 
Well Is 
It Know to the Market? 


AlthoughAVs 
are 
constantly 
being 
discussed in press/analyst circles, we think the 
market remains 
in the fairly early innings 
of truly modeling the long-term 
net 
implications 
and the resulting 
winners and losers, which 
at times requires local-level 
(city/county) modeling. Part of this 
stems from the market’s 
having seemingly spent 
far greater time focusing 
on electric vehicles in recent years, no doubt a function 
of 
Tesla’s 
emergence. AVs were in discussion, but more so from a feature 
perspective 
(cars 
offering semi-autonomous features) as opposed to theAV Network 
perspective, where the real disruption lies, 
in 
our view. To be 
sure, in the past 6–8 
months 
AVs have 
seen greater emphasis 
on 
AV Networks 
thanks 
to high-profile 
transactions and other events. But we still see 
several 
misconceptions that suggest 
to us that the 
net opportunity isn’t deeply understood yet: 

For example: 


• 
We 
don’t think 
it’s 
commonly recognized that the impact on 
individual vehicle 
segments and regions is likely 
to vary widely. We believe that the 
most disrupted 
areas will be 
sedans in 
larger cities 
and/or good weather states. Least disrupted 
are commercial vehicles (pickup trucks/vans) in rural 
and/or poor weather states. 
Investing in a world of AVs requires far more 
local 
knowledge of individual 
markets (urban battlegrounds), as 
opposed to the 
more 
traditional 
country/continent analytical 
approach. We think market observers still 
paint the 
industry in 
broad strokes (all XYZ companies will be…) as 
opposed to 
focusing 
on detailed 
segment and regional analysis. We 
think this will 
change as 
RoboTaxis commercialize. 
• 
Recent investor attention 
has focused 
on the Robotaxi (mobility-as-a-service) 
industry. To be 
sure, we’ve written about RoboTaxis for years 
and view 
them 
as 
a 
very sizable 
component of theAV Network disruption. But it’s 
just the 
start 
— 
we 
don’t think there’s nearly enough emphasis on the 
AV 
Subscription component of 
the long-term 
opportunity. Again, the 
common reaction 
tends 
to paint very broad 
outcomes 
— 
all 
consumers will cease to own cars everywhere (at times 
contradicting one of the 
biggest bull cases for EVs, which is the fun-to-drive 
factor) 
— 
as opposed to breaking down the impact in city vs. rural, individual 
vehicle segments, and how networks can 
combine 
the value 
of ‘owning’ 
with the 
value of sharing/subscribing.All of this carries 
major investing implications. 
How Big Might the Opportunity Be? 

We 
estimate the U.S. RoboTaxi addressable revenue market at $900 
billion, or 
~$0.60 per mile on ~1.5 
trillion 
urban/suburban miles driven (representing 
~50% 
of 
all 
U.S. miles driven). 
The network-effect element described 
above suggests that 
this will 
be a few-regional-winners-take-all 
market. 


The 
AV Subscription 
market is 
also sizable 
particularly when 
considering the 
potential historic transfer of wealth 
in the automotive 
supply chain 
— 
arguably from 
the rental 
car and 
aftermarket revenue 
channels into the 
AV network. As 
noted 
previously, we 
roughly estimate a fleet of 100,000 
AV Subscribers 
can earn 
$2.5 
billion 
of lifetime gross 
profit.

If AVs brought household vehicle density 
down from 2.2x to 1.0x, there would be a 
drastic 54% reduction in the number of cars 
on the road 

The disruption is a change of the delivery of 
mobility from a product to more of a network 

Defensive attributes include exposure to 
rural areas, commercial vehicles, and snow-
heavy states. 

Offensive attributes include strong AV 
technology and a clear AV business plan 

Let’s do some back-of-the-envelope 
math: 
Today, 
an 
automaker might earn $8,500 
of variable profit per unit sold, and then 
let’s 
say another $1,500 
from follow-on 
services etc. 
The U.S. light vehicle population stands at 272 
million, meaning that 
an automaker’s lifetime vehicle profit TAM is $2.7 trillion. Now let’s assume that AVs 
eventually bring down household vehicle density to 1.0x from 2.2x today 
— 
a drastic 
move that would see 
a 54% reduction 
in the number of cars 
on the road. 

To be sure, outside 
of urban RoboTaxis 
affecting personally-owned car ownership 
in 
cities 
and 
close 
surrounding 
suburbs, we don’t think that 
the 
remainingAV business 
models (AV Subscribers) would necessarily lead to 
a substantially reduced vehicle-
density outcome, due to the value of having instant access to mobility. Our prior 
modeling has 
shown a ~12% 
decline 
in future U.S. demand 
(new vehicle 
sales) by 
2030E. Nonetheless, going with the 
54% 
decline 
for a moment would mean that we 
have 126 million light vehicles 
on the road. Our AV Subscription math previously 
showed a lifetime adjusted 
gross profit of $29,000 
per vehicle, which would amount 
to $3.7 trillion on 126 million vehicles on 
the road. 
This 
suggests that the total 
lifetime profit pool 
actually rises by >30%. 


So the 
disruption 
isn’t necessarily about an auto industry going away or even 
shrinking (quite the 
opposite), but rather a drastic change of the delivery of mobility 
from a product to 
more 
of a network 
— 
and all the resulting changes in supply-chain 
economics, winners and 
losers within the auto industry itself, 
and the impact to 
existing industry stakeholders. 


What Are Barriers to Adoption? 


The 
AV technology itself is rapidly improving toward a likely commercialization 
in 
certain domains (geo-fenced zones, speeds, weather conditions) in a 
matter of 
months as opposed to years. When 
it comes to adoption barriers, rather, we tend 
to 
think of consumer acceptance 
and regulations. Inevitably, things 
do and will go 
wrong and unfortunately tragedies and mistakes do occur. 
To be 
sure, we view such 
risks 
more 
as 
setback potential than a 
‘willAVs happen?’ 
question; the latter we 
believe has already become fairly inevitable. 

To be sure, human-driven cars andAVs will 
coexist for a 
long time to 
come, even 
with a rapid scaling 
of RoboTaxi and eventualAV Subscriptions. Of course, 
the 
investment community’s perception of winners/losers might change rapidly, 
well 
beforeAVs scale to 
higher volumes (similar to what we’ve seen with the EV theme), 
once theAV end-game becomes more 
apparent to the broad investment 
community. 

Who Are the Winners & Losers? Who Gets Displaced? 

On the automaker side, we consider defensive & offensive 
attributes. Desired 
defensive attributes include having greater exposure to rural 
areas, commercial 
vehicles (pickups vans), 
and snow-heavy states. If you 
can find all three, that’s’ a 
good 
start. Offensive 
qualities 
include 
having strongAV technology and a clear AV 
business plan 
that considers all of the 
important network and product aspects 
discussed earlier. For example, for RoboTaxis the 
AV tech is 
of course most 
important, but nearly as 
important is the vehicle 
itself 
— 
EVs 
will be advantaged 
and 
purpose-built likely superior to 
retrofits, and their 
ability to scale efficiently will be 
an 
advantage: 
servicing, fleet management, cybersecurity etc. For AV Subscriptions, 
advantages will 
extend to having a full 
line of vehicles for swapping, a liquid dealer 
network for 
peer-to-peer management, 
and robust connectivity/security. Therefore, 
we look for companies that bring both defensive and offensive qualities 
to the table.

For auto suppliers, we look for companies 
who can sell more content on AVs. 

For auto suppliers, we look for companies

This 
would include the 
AV technology suite itself to the vehicle electrical 
architecture, 
cockpit electronics, 
and other experience-related content (seats, displays). 


The potentially dramatic shift 
in 
industry dynamics 
and 
profit pools is also 
bound to 
affect stakeholder industries to automotive: 


• 
How 
will the traditional rental 
car industry respond to potential competition from 
AV peer-to-peer (sourcing cars from 
AV subscribers)? 
• 
How 
will the auto aftermarket respond if AV Networks attempt to take back 
aftermarket/maintenance profit pools that today sit outside of their ecosystem? 
• 
If personalAVs 
can 
do 
last-mile delivery to your home, how does that affect 
freight and retail 
companies? 
• 
The impact on insurance companies and repair shops if accidents decline? 
• 
Who benefits 
from unlocking time spent in 
cars previously dedicated to driving? 
• 
Real estate in cities if to the extent fewer parking spots are eventually needed? 
• 
Real estate in general 
if living 
near a 
city becomes less of an advantage thanks 
to reduced traffic or AV commuter cars being able to travel 
faster (admittedly this 
is a 
longer-term 
consideration)?
