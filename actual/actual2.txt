Chapter A: Artificial Intelligence - 
the Finance Moment 

“What stocks go up the most when a Category 3 hurricane hits Florida? Which 
stocks go up when Apple releases a new iPad?” Google-style, you can type these 
questions into Kensho’s platform and receive real-time answers based on machine 
learning. Kensho’s algorithm, originally called Warren after Warren Buffet, crunches 
millions of market data points to discover correlations and investment opportunities. 

Daniel Nadler, founder of Kensho, notes: "Artificial intelligence is a misnomer. It's 
accelerated intelligence. It's about doing things, which historically you thought were 
impossible for a human being to do, at a blinding speed." (Forbes, March 6, 2018). 
“The coming era will be looked back upon as the ‘AI era,’ when AI became the 
defining competitive advantage for corporations, government agencies and 
investment professionals” (David Nadler, Kensho press release, February 2017). 

AI is having a finance moment. Earlier this month, when Kensho was purchased by 
S&P Global for approximately $550 million, it was noted that “the biggest A.I. deal 
comes out of Wall Street (from a 158-year institution no less) and not Silicon Valley” 
(Forbes, March 6, 2018). In this chapter of our report, we take a deeper dive into 
some of the use cases in banking and finance today. 

Evolution of AI – Why Now? 

Advances in computing power, data volume, and connectivity are core components 
of the industrialization of AI, and together they are leading an explosion in AI 
applications, including in financial services. 

• 
High-Performance Computing, with the adoption of new algorithms and new 
computing tools, has improved the learning ability and usability of AI. 
• 
Increases in the number of devices and sensors connected to the Internet of 
Things are facilitating enormous amounts of data over the Internet. 
• 
Big Data generated by digitalized processes at economical prices are helping 
accumulate enormous amounts of data, which can then be processed to 
generate high-value insights with machine learning.

Automation and AI are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are, of course, 
some large differences. Automation is software that follows pre-programmed rules, 
allowing machines to perform repetitive monotonous tasks, freeing up time for 
humans to focus on tasks that require a personal touch. 

AI, on the other hand, is designed to simulate human thinking by constantly seeking 
patterns, learning from experience, and providing responses based on situational 
awareness. Machine learning refers to a set of algorithms that enables it to 
recognize patterns from large datasets and then apply these findings to new data. 

Deep learning is a sub-field of AI, where machine learning is based on a set of 
algorithms that attempt to model high levels of abstractions into usable data, mimicking 
the human brain. It requires the use of neural networks to learn from data and extend 
the ability of machines to react to nuances or the introduction of new data.

Artificial Intelligence has been discussed in academic circles for many decades. A 
1956 workshop at Dartmouth College in the U.S. is credited with coining the term 
Artificial Intelligence. Alan Turing’s 1950 paper on “Computing machinery and 
intelligence” opened with the sentence “Can machines think?” 

However, after the initial enthusiasm in academia and popular culture, as with many 
emergent technology hype cycles, AI entered a slump. The first “AI winter” in 
academic funding and popular interest began in the early 1970s and after a brief 
recovery was followed by a second “AI winter” in the late 1980s. 

AI gained the limelight in the media and popular culture in 1996-97, after IBM's “Deep 
Blue” supercomputer beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov. But it is in the past 
few years that we have seen several mainstream applications of AI, driven by: 

1. research reducing AI error rates to human levels; 
2. GPU-increased calculation power; and 
3. increased power and capacity to store data and reduce costs. 
The way we use AI in our everyday life is rapidly changing — from static image 
recognition and tagging in social media platforms (Facebook, Google) to automated 
bots and complex natural language processing of voice commands (Siri, Google 
Now, Amazon Echo) to autonomous driving and fully functioning robots.

Industrialization of AI – Spending and Investing More 
Banking & Securities Is the Largest Non-Tech Industry for AI 
Outside the tech sector itself, financial services is one of the leading early adopters 
of AI. According to the IDC, the banking and securities sector is not only the biggest 
spender on external AI services but is also expected see fast spending growth over 
the next five years. Most bank investments are focused on risk management, fraud 
prevention, and compliance activities. 
Figure 12. Market Sizes for Various AI Vertical Markets (2016-2019E) 
AI startups seem most focused on applying AI solutions to verticals such as FinTech, 
insurance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and developing general-purpose/predictive 
analytics. Within FinTech, we are seeing use of AI for credit scoring/direct lending, 
regulatory/compliance & fraud detection, business finance & expense reporting, 
insurance, quantitative & asset management, assistants, and personal finance. 
According to data from CB Insights, total AI funding in 2017 reached $15.2 billion 
(+144% year over year), spread over 1,349 deals. By geography, the U.S. still leads 
globally in terms of the number of AI startups and total equity deals but is gradually 
losing its previous overwhelming dominance.

AI in the U.S. is dominated by tech companies such as Amazon (predicting and 
analyzing customer shopping patterns); Google (strong AI push, acquired 50+ AI 
startups in 2015-16); IBM (high-profile Watson AI service); Apple (acquired four AI 
startups in 2015-16 for its digital assistants, facial/voice recognition); and Facebook 
(analyzing big data on social media). 

AI in China is driven by the three Chinese tech giants – Baidu, Didi, and Tencent – 
that already possess advanced image/voice recognition and have set up their own 
AI research labs. Chinese financial institutions are also active here, with players 
such as Ping An utilizing AI for customer service, investments and insurance 
products, and fraud detection in the cards business. 

Rising M&A – BigTech giants such as Google, Baidu, Apple, Intel, Facebook and 
Microsoft have increased their focus on AI, with more spend on internal R&D and 
deployment as well as targeted acquisition of startups. Since 2012, over 300 private 
firms using AI across different verticals have been acquired, not just by BigTech 
companies but also by traditional insurance, retail, and healthcare incumbents.

Race for patents – The number of AI-related patents filed by tech giants has 
steadily increased since 2014, with leading players such as Google and Microsoft 
filing as many as over 300 patents, individually, since 2009. By geography, we find 

U.S. and Chinese companies on top with the most registered patents.
