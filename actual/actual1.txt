The Bank of the Future 

"I still remember my first day at DBS. When I told the Singapore taxi (driver) where I 
was going and he said, "DBS -Damn, Bloody, Slow." There's no doubt that in 2009 
DBS had a well-earned reputation for being a bureaucratic, unimaginative and 
unresponsive bank." 

- 
Digital Innovations in a Singapore Bank: 10 lessons learnt when DBS came out of 
the Stone Age, by Paul Cobban, Chief Data and Transformation Office, DBS Bank, 
April 2017) 

DBS in Singaporean culture was called damn bloody slow and worse. But it wasn't 
the only bank living in "the Stone Age" relative to efficiency and speed levels in 
best-in-class manufacturing or technology companies. As the Great Financial Crisis 
pushed banks, especially in Europe and the U.S., into a period of conservatism, 
introspection, and de-risking, a tsunami of technological change was shaking up the 
rest of the world, especially the mobile consumer world. 

Client experience in banks is still "Stone Age". Opening a small business account at 
a major U.K. “high street” bank can take over a month. At a U.K. neo-bank, the 
same process can take minutes. And client experience at banks is often lousy, as 
incumbent banks are built on "Stone Age" technology. Combined with bureaucratic 
and siloed organizational structures and regulatory burdens, it is no surprise that 
banks have very slow metabolic rates. 

Product cycles in banks take a long time. One U.K. bank we know has a three-fold 
approach: (1) 8-12 weeks is its fastest rollout; (2) 6-10 months for large product 
changes, such as mortgage agreements in principle; and (3) 3-5 years+ for large 
waterfall programs. The best-in-class Emerging Market financial company moves at 
a speed 5x-10x that of a typical larger bank. And BigTechs and FinTechs move even 
faster still. 

We recently discussed the topic of speed with the technology chief of one of the 
leading Emerging Market financial firms. In his view, the difference in metabolic 
rates between his current tech-geared employer and his previous long-established 
bank employer was due to "soft factors," such as clear ownership of decision 
making, accountability for results, and a speed-imbued culture as well as "hard 
factors," such as automation, agile development, and Cloud-ready deployment. 

Bill Gates famously said over two decades ago, "Banks are dinosaurs, they can be 
bypassed" (American Banker, January 9, 1995). Yes, the banking dinosaurs still 
exist. But a technological meteor hit the industry, especially in consumer financial 
services, with the arrival of the mobile-first smartphone era from around 2008 and 
the growth of Internet platform conglomerates. 

The Bank of the Future is emerging in front of us. Amazon isn't the Bank of the 
Future, nor is WeChat. These companies have goals bigger than banking. But they 
are already part of finance. And they and their peers will be part of the financial 
services ecosystem of the future. 

To quote Bill Gates again from 1994-95, "we need banking, not banks." The future 
of finance is an increasingly converged ecosystem where consumer and small and 
medium enterprise (SME) financial services are provided by banks and by platform 
companies with roots in e-commerce/social media. So how do incumbent banks 
stay relevant? They have to become faster. They have to become smarter. They 
have to become more efficient.

Staying relevant will require an ongoing transformation of the incumbent bank’s 
existing business model, organizational structure, culture, and technology 
infrastructure. Among other factors, the banks’ strategic game plan will have to 
include the greater use of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation and the related 
overhaul of Core Banking systems and increased adoption of Cloud-based services. 
These are some of the key topics we cover in this report, “The Bank of the Future: 
The ABCs of Digital Disruption in Finance.” 

A is for Artificial Intelligence and Automation 

The acquisition of Kensho in March 2017, the largest AI acquisition to date, 
illustrates how AI is having a finance moment. Banks are exploring AI uses in 
consumer and wholesale banking with the help of robotics (automation of routine 
tasks), analytics (big data mining), chat bots (digital dialogue with customers), and 
cognitive (changing rules and adapting). This should make the banks smarter, 
faster, and more robust. 

Outside the tech sector itself, financial services are one of the leading early 
adopters of AI in terms of spending, and in our chapter on artificial intelligence, we 
do a deep dive into some of the use cases of AI in banking and finance today. We 
also include interviews with the CEOs of two AI-based private companies: Active AI, 
a conversational banking service provider, and Behavox, a people analytics 
company primarily focused on compliance and risk. 

As we discuss in our interview with Ramneek Gupta from Citi Ventures, the 
successful implementation of AI at an enterprise level for banks includes good data. 
Banks have a lot of data. Banks have more data than most other institutions. But 
most incumbent bank data assets tend to be siloed and not easily accessible. This 
is due to regulatory constraints but also poor technology stacks and organizational 
structures. Banks in markets such as the U.S. and Europe are often built on 1960s70s 
mainframe technology that is product-based, not customer-based. 

Most banks lag digital natives, such as the some FinTech upstarts, which are ahead 
at implementing AI, as their systems are based on machine learning (ML) and AI 
and require minimal human intervention. For the FinTechs, data generation begins 
from the time a client is onboarded; subsequent transaction history is accessible 
easily, and product cycles are fast. FinTechs such as Square are built on data being 
a key foundational building block (along with customer-centric product design) that 
is widely leveraged across the board from customer acquisition, servicing, 
operations, risk management, and compliance. 

Banks are, of course, aware that their technology stacks are not fit for competing in 
a world that is mobile first (for some regions and demographics, mobile only) and 
increasingly dominated by Internet platform-based conglomerates. Several banks 
are beginning to centralize their data assets and are leveraging hybrid cloud 
architectures to speed up the transition. Banks that are typically single country or 
have relatively simple business lines, such as Capital One or USAA, are often cited 
at the forefront of digital transformation. 

And once banks have improved data, the next step is to speed up product 
development cycles. Banks usually move at a glacial speed, with product updates 
measured in the months or even years, as we noted at the start of this chapter. 
Such long product development cycles render AI implementation moot, as the new 
data insights gleaned cannot be incorporated into the business in time. Our 
comment on glacial speed is primarily about incumbent banks in consumer and 
commercial banking. Capital markets product development and technology cycles, 
in the wholesale banking units, is often much faster.

We believe wide adoption of AI and automation will have a profound impact on 
banks' distribution and servicing channels. As discussed in our earlier 2016 GPS 
report (Digital Disruption; How FinTech is Forcing Banking to a Tipping Point), banks 
in developed markets are expected to cut their number of branches by another 3050% 
from 2014 levels. The Nordic banks have exceeded our expectations with 
branch density down nearly 25% in just two years. Europe has overall tracked our 
expectations. The U.S. banks have initially lagged our expectations, with branch 
densities not changing much from 2014 to 2016, but we believe we may be 
reaching an inflexion point in 2017-18. 

We are definitely past “peak banker,” especially in markets such as Europe and the 

U.S. Increased use of automation and AI-driven systems is likely to help banks 
improve cost efficiencies by employing fewer workers as repetitive human tasks are 
replaced by machines that can understand human behavior and make decisions. As 
far back as 2015, Antony Jenkins, former Barclays CEO, noted that “the number of 
branches and people employed in the financial services sector may decline by as 
much as 50% over the next 10 years, and even in a less harsh scenario I predict 
they will decline by at least 20%.” 
In 2017, John Cryan, Deutsche Bank CEO, told a Frankfurt conference: “In our bank 
we have people doing work like robots. Tomorrow we will have robots behaving like 
people.” 

B Is for BigTech, Especially in Asia and Emerging Markets 

When bankers worry about the future, the fear is BigTech, not FinTech. The old 
question was, will banks become innovative before the new entrants (FinTechs) get 
scale. A decade after the Great Financial Crisis, banks struggle with innovation and 
speed. But they can try and "buy innovation" via partnering or acquiring new 
entrants. And banks can buy innovation faster than FinTechs can acquire new 
clients. 

But when the new entrant is a BigTech, the equation changes: it comes with preexisting 
scale and client reach, sometimes greater than the banks themselves. 
BigTech is the B in the ABC of Digital Disruption in financial services, and in this 
report, we consider the revenue and cost challenges BigTechs create, directly and 
indirectly, for incumbent banks. 

The Internet-based platform companies - 
such as Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook or 
Tencent - 
have captured an ever-increasing share of consumers’ time and attention. 
These platform companies view payments and financial services not as an end in 
itself but as a tool to further enhance client stickiness, and they monetize via 
advertising, e-commerce, or other services (such as AWS). And when these 
platform companies have gone into payments and finance, mainly in emerging 
markets so far, they have gone big. 

Finance is being re-imagined and re-created in emerging markets by BigTech 
players with the proliferation of mobile platforms, a growing middle class, and 
favorable government policies. Ten-fold improvements are more likely in new 
markets that can “leapfrog” established technology - 
e.g., go mobile first/only, 
skipping the landline phase in telecom. When it comes to BigTech in finance, 
Zennon Kapron notes in his Chapter B interview that “we are seeing the future 
today” in China. New entrants have made a mark in the consumer payments and 
finance space in Asia, especially in China, but also increasingly in markets such as 
Korea and India.

Case Study 1: Kakao Bank launched in Korea, backed by the KakaoTalk 
messaging app with ~42 million clients, gained 2 million banking clients within two 
weeks of its launch and recently had ~5 million clients. Kakao Bank offers a better 
user experience, such as easy access/online-only authentication, as well as lower 
loan rate/fees. The first Internet bank in Korea, K-Bank, has grown more slowly – 
platform company support matters.

Case Study 2: WhatsApp has been beta testing its Indian payments offering with 
~1 million clients. Currently, over 200 million Indians use WhatsApp for messaging: 
by 2019, many (perhaps most) of these social users could also be payments users. 
WhatsApp doesn’t currently have an advertising revenue model to support its 
payments growth, but its parent, Facebook, does. 

FinTechs are likely to be service providers to the banks, and in certain niches (for 
example, remittances or cross-border retail payments), they may also be 
competitors to banks. But FinTechs today are more friends than foes of the banks. 
And many could "exit" as purchases by the incumbents. We see BigTech as the 
major future competitor, as well as collaborator, for the banking industry. We discuss 
this in greater detail in Chapter B. 

C Is for Core Banking, Cloud, and Challengers 

Banks are aware they face a customer expectations revolution – and it is not just 
from millennials! Cloud and more modern architecture offer solutions to legacy IT 
issues and could help improve efficiency, agility, and speed to market. And while 
they may offer cost and marketing gain opportunities in the future, in the near term, 
banks’ IT costs (already the highest of any sector) are going even higher.

# Total IT expenditure includes operating expenditure and IT capital expenditure

Interestingly, the U.S. and Australian banks have increased their IT spend since the 
global financial crisis, whereas the Europeans in aggregative have not. This is 
probably not surprising, as banks operating in a better financial environment have 
had the resources and the management time to spend more on long-term planning. 
The implications for European banks are stark: after many years of fire-fighting and 
rationing investments, it is time to expand time horizons and focus on long-range 
transformation. IT cost spend increase appears to be here to stay.

And what are banks spending on? A survey by Temenos identified core banking 
systems (deposits, lending, and transaction processing) as the main focus area for 
banks. This is no surprise, as it is a key driver of long-term efficiency and a 
prerequisite to maximizing return on investment (ROI) in other areas. Investment in 
digital channels was a close second.

As Jonathan Larsen, Chairman/CEO of the Ping An Voyager fund, notes in Chapter 
C, “Legacy platforms relying on mainframe systems are a big problem holding the 
banking industry back and making any changes is very complex/cumbersome. As a 
result, Antony (Jenkins) started with a blank paper and created a new system from 
scratch to improve the banking experience, incorporating machine learning, cloud 
services, encryption at all states etc.” The Voyager Fund led the last funding round 
by 10X Technologies run by Antony Jenkins. 

For a deep dive into core banking IT infrastructure, cloud-based services, 
competition from challenger banks, and the cost implications of all the above, turn to 
Chapter C of this report.
