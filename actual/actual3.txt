Chapter B: BigTech or the ANTification 
of Finance 

Finance is being re-imagined and re-created in emerging markets (EM) by FinTech 
and BigTech players with the proliferation of mobile platforms, a growing middle 
class, and favorable government policies. New entrants have made a mark in the 
consumer payments and finance space in Asia, especially in China and increasingly 
in India. In this chapter, we take a closer look at how BigTech, rather than FinTech, 
poses a competitive threat and a collaborative opportunity for incumbent banks. 

“10x” improvements are more likely in new markets that can “leapfrog” established 
technology – e.g., go mobile first/only, skipping the landline phase in telecom. In 
China, e-commerce giant Alibaba has amassed the world's largest money market 
fund and issued nearly $100 billion of loans in five years, whereas in India, mobile 
wallets provider Paytm has nearly 280 million registered users with an average 
transaction value of INR500 ($7.50) per day. In developed markets, B2C FinTech 
plays have not reached the scale of their Asian peers with a few exceptions, most 
notably PayPal. 

Traditional banking is being challenged not by small FinTech startups but rather by 
established tech giants (particularly in emerging markets) leveraging their strong 
customer bases, vast user data pools, agile technology platforms, and deep funding 
pockets. BigTech giants are eroding the boundaries between industries as they 
seek to be all things to all people. While payments and transaction services are 
often the first area of disruption by BigTech, the end objective is creation of an 
integrated financial ecosystem as part of a holistic customer engagement strategy. 

But do clients want to do banking with BigTech? According to a survey by Deloitte in 
“Millennials and Wealth Management,” nearly 57% of U.S. millennials cited that they 
would change their bank for a better tech platform, while 65% would consider 
leaving a firm if digital channels are not integrated (Capgemini World Wealth 
Report). But banks are still trusted, even if not loved. U.S. retail banking clients still 
trust their primary bank more than BigTech on money matters. But the survey data 
would probably look different for U.S. millennials and for EM-based clients.

Chinese BigTech and Financial Services 

The presence of Chinese Internet giants Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com 
(BATJ) in finance is striking if we consider that (1) China’s largest e-commerce 
platform also runs China’s largest mutual fund (Yu’e Bao by Ant Financial), and (2) 
the Chinese social messaging app facilitates large volumes of money transfers / 
payments (WeChat by Tencent). 

BATJ have made rapid progress in Internet finance, backed by agile tech platforms 
and a high degree of service integration (leveraging their ecosystem to offer 
scenario-based services). Notably, each one of them differed in their initial roots – 
Alibaba and JD.com started off with an e-commerce platform, Tencent expanded its 
social media messaging platform, while Baidu built on its online advertising 
business model as a search engine. 

Over the years, these Chinese BigTech firms have established a comprehensive 
multi-licensed financial ecosystem, including a payments interface, wealth 
management products, consumer finance, and insurance products, among others. 
Figure 29 compares their primary financial services offered.

We believe BATJ enjoys considerable competitive advantages that help position 
them favorably when competing with incumbent banks, including (1) a large and 
captive user base; (2) low online acquisition cost; (3) big data customer insights 
(helps product pricing and risk management); and (4) Internet banking licenses. 

Additionally, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent (BAT) have also invested in new online 
banks that do not need physical branches and have fewer overheads. It is expected 
that the technological advantage of BAT provides them with a unique advantage to 
leverage technologies such as big data and cloud computing, which can help tailor 
user experiences and improve credit assessment procedures.

– Sesame Credit – launched January 2015, in 11 months to >100m cumulative 
users 
– Yu’e Bao – launched June 2013, in 20 months to >100m cumulative users; 
– Insurance – launched November 2010, in 31 months to >100m cumulative 
users 
• 
Yu’e Bao: convenient cash management service – This money market fund 
provides convenient cash management service for users and provides a 
foundation for other wealth management services. Yu’e Bao is the largest in the 
world, with assets of ~RMB1.5 trillion (~$230bn) and a cumulative user base of 
about 330 million, which translates to an average c.RMB4,500 ($710) per user. 
Yu’e Bao’s real advantage is its strong technology edge, which enables high-
frequency usage owing to great user experience and ever-expanding user 
scenarios. The platform also benefits from Big Data, which helps in liquidity risk 
management, such as analysis of future redemption ratios. 
• 
Zhao Cai Bao: P2P lending platform – Started in 2014, the platform lets small 
businesses and individual borrowers directly raise loans from investors provided 
that a financial institution has guaranteed the loan and made sure money will be 
paid back (each loan is divided across a maximum of 200 investors). Average 
loan sizes are ~RMB70,000 ($11k), with durations of 3-12 months and 
annualized interest rates of 3-5%. 
• 
Hua Bei (Ant Check later) – Launched in December 2014, Hua Bei is an online 
consumer loan product offered to Alipay users for purchase of goods or services 
approved by Ant Financial (usually at Taobao or Tmall). The maximum lending 
amount is up to Rmb30k ($4,750), with an interest-free period of 50 days, and 
average loan size is ~RMB3,000 ($475) per borrower. Huabei has achieved good 
synergy with Ali’s e-commerce platforms by effectively promoting one’s 
consumption. As of the first half of 2017, the outstanding loan balance of Hua Bei 
reached Rmb160 billion ($25bn). Meanwhile, the big data derived from the 
transactions via Hua Bei also allows Ant Financial to provide more customized 
financial services to its customers. 
• 
Jie Bei – Jie Bei is an online cash loan product launched by Ant Financial in 
2015. The loan applications are made on the Alipay platform, with loans being 
directly transferred to the borrower’s Alipay account. The credit line ranges from 
Rmb1k to Rmb50k (~$150-$8k), with typical loan duration of up to 12 months, 
depending on the borrowers’ Sesame Credit Score, and average loan size is 
c.RMB700 ($110) per borrower. As of mid-2017, the outstanding loan balance of 
Jie Bei had reached ~Rmb100 billion ($16bn). However, Ant Financial suspended 
the Jie Bei service for certain users in early 2018 as a result of regulatory 
tightening on cash loan products and imposed a leverage cap for online micro 
credit companies (MCCs) by including all loans financed via off-balance sheet 
ABS (leverage of Ant Financial’s MCC subsidiaries – i.e., the lending entities for 
Huabei and Jiabei – reached ~70x as of 1H17, compared to the regulatory cap of 
2.3x). 
• 
MYbank – Launched in January 2015, MYbank offers three kinds of loans that tie 
in with Alibaba’s core businesses: (1) for people in rural areas; (2) for Internet 
start-ups, and (3) for Tmall/Taobao sellers. MYbank strictly operates small/midsized 
ticket loans and does not accept any loan application over RMB5 million. 
The bank offers no physical branches and operates entirely on a cloud

computing platform using Big Data to compute loan amounts and terms, thus 
saving significantly on operational costs. Loan application processes are quick 
(usually lasting just three minutes), following which, if approved, the loan 
amounts are wired to the individual’s bank account. As of June 2017, the bank 
funded loans of RMB115 billion in value, with an average loan size of 
~RMB17,000 (~$2,700).

urbanization trends, serve rural areas, drive financial inclusion; (2) collaborate with 
local partners through technology transfer, make financial services more accessible; 

(3) generate dynamic data from the business, in turn feeding the business 
ecosystem. The aim is to serve 2 billion customers globally in ten years. 
[B] Tencent's WeChat Is China's App for Everything 
Weixin (WeChat) Pay – Tencent owns and operates Tenpay, which allows users to 
transfer money through WeChat, a social messaging app. With 980 million monthly 
active user accounts as of September 2017 (+16% YoY), Tencent’s Weixin mobile 
messaging app has become a powerful multi-function platform, including for 
integrating third-party services, including payments and financial services. Weixin 
Pay and QQ Wallet are consumer-facing mobile payment solutions that expand use 
cases for social (red envelop gifting and money transfers), Online to Offline (O2O) 
services, and online finance. Based on a Tencent survey, about 70% of respondents 
spend more than RMB100 ($15) per month in payments and transfers, with the 
most popular function being digital red envelope money (85% of respondents), 
followed by payments (58%) and money transfer to contacts (57%). WeChat credit 
card (payment processed via scanning QR code) was used by 20% of respondents, 
and 14% used Weixin Pay to pay off credit cards. 

WeBank – In 2015, Tencent launched WeBank, China’s first online-only bank, based in 
Shenzhen. WeBank is essentially a “connector” of individuals and small enterprises to 
banks and financial institutions. Key services include offering investment products, such 
as money market funds, and granting loans to small and medium-sized companies, 
farmers, and individuals. In May 2015, WeBank launched its first loan product, Weilidai, 
providing microcredit to users amounts up to RMB200k ($30k) without the need for 
guarantee or collateral, at a daily interest rate of 0.05% (approximately 20% annually). 
WeBank promotes its services on WeChat and QQ, its dominant social media apps. As 
of June 2017, WeBank extended total loans of RMB200 billion ($30bn) in value with an 
average loan size of RMB8,000 ($1,250).
