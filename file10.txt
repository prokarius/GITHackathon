9. Real Estate Market Disruptors 
FinTech Innovators 
Are Changing the Way 
We 
Trade 
Houses 


Buying and selling 
a home 
is 
one of the 
more stressful 
life events 
many will go 
through. If you have ever done it, you 
may have dealt with highly irrational 
counterparties, the stress of always keeping a home show-ready, or having 
had to 
sweat out transaction 
details like title 
search 
issues or drawn-out loan 
underwriting. 
And all of this happened with brokers who earn 
~5% 
commission from the seller 
and take zero 
principal 
risk. 


A growing group of intrepid 
FinTech firms 
in Europe and the 
U.S. 
are deploying 
models 
to displace this 
traditional real estate brokerage 
model. Many of these new 
businesses are executing strategies 
that 
aim to speed the transaction timeline 
for 
buyers and 
sellers while lowering overall transaction 
costs (financial 
and/or 
emotional). 


Some 
of the many 
different business models currently in 
play are 
listed 
below 
but 
for simplicity, our primarily focus 
will be 
on 
the first strategy: 


• 
Instant Offers (“I-Buyer” Model): 
Several companies, both public 
and 
private, 
are now deploying 
strategies that provide offers on homes to willing 
sellers. Offer 
prices factor in 
a discount that looks 
similar to a broker commission, but closing 
times can be as few as weeks 
for the seller versus months. The company takes 
ownership 
of the property, potentially makes 
repairs, and 
sells 
the home 
through 
various 
potential channels. 
• 
Customer-led Vertical Integration: 
This is a 
strategy 
in which 
a 
company 
identifies 
potential buyers and 
works 
with them 
to purchase a home. This is very 
similar to a broker model, but in this case the company makes a 
cash offer on the 
chosen 
home and carries the 
property while the ultimate owner arranges 
financing. The value-add is that cash offers may be accepted 
and potential 
buyers 
can 
avoid a bidding war. 
• 
Fixed Broker Fees: 
This strategy simply charges a fixed fee as opposed 
to a 
percentage commission. Companies involved in this 
strategy leverage the 
democratization of data 
and 
employ technology platforms to 
help 
drive 
efficiencies 
in their broker network. 
Framing the Scope of the Issue 


Housing is 15% 
of GDP 
in 
the 
U.S. and the 
largest asset class on 
household 
balance 
sheets, with 
$1.5 
trillion 
worth of residential real estate sold annually. That’s 
10x the size of 
Treasury bond 
issuance being 
transacted via 
direct negotiation, and 
it happens between buyers and sellers who are 5x–20x levered in most cases. 


Because 
it is such a 
concentrated storage of wealth and such a large source of 
household debt, 
liquidity and 
transaction 
speed are meaningful to 
the 
average 
home 
seller. In May of this year, the 
peak of the 
selling season, the median 
amount of time 
homes had been 
listed 
for sale was 55 days. 
The carrying 
cost over this amount of 
time 
could 
be as 
much as 1% 
of the 
home’s value. Not to 
mention the 
economic 
impact this delay has due to 
impaired household 
mobility. It 
would be like needing a 
new car, but having to wait and sell your current car on craigslist before you could 
buy a new one. 
There’s no dealership 
trade-in option for moving, and the cost of 
this 
delay to a 
home seller is about as 
much as…the down payment on a 
car.

Post the bursting of the housing bubble in 
the U.S., many innovations have emerged to 
disrupt the cost of brokering the sale of a 
home 

Why Is This Happening Now? 

The financial crisis 
and 
burst of the housing ‘bubble’ 
in the U.S. 
are 
well 
documented. Financial 
institutions failed, housing credit availability dried up, and 
government intervention 
occurred on 
many levels to 
stabilize and regulate the 
industry. Home 
prices 
fell ~26% 
nationally during 
this period, and 
some metro 
areas 
like Phoenix and Las Vegas are still ~20% 
below their previous peak 
more than ten 
years later. 


During the post-crash period, many innovations 
and 
developments took 
place 
that 
led the industry to 
make attempts to finally disrupt the 
cost of brokering the sale of a 
home. We generally attribute this 
disruption to a few key drivers: 


• 
Democratization of data: 
Websites 
and 
data 
providers 
started publicly posting 
residential real 
estate 
listings 
as 
early as 
2006. This democratization of data has 
grown consistently over time and moved into 
mobile. What was once 
only 
available to real estate agents 
on the Multiple 
Listing 
Service 
(MLS) is now 
available to virtually everyone 
via apps 
on their smart phones. Most of this 
democratization, however, has been 
driven 
by broker advertising revenue. 
• 
Proof of concept in mortgage originations: 
It’s no surprise the U.S. 
financial 
crisis yielded regulation in 
housing finance. Lenders are now required to start 
verifying, documenting, and reporting borrower credit characteristics to 
a much 
higher standard, 
and non-compliance 
bears 
significant consequences. These 
heightened standards drove 
a 
desperately-needed technology update, and 
FinTech lenders have proven their ability to leverage technology and 
boost 
efficiency. In a recent staff paper from the New 
York Federal 
Reserve, analysts 
examined loan-level origination data and found that FinTech 
lenders are able to 
close a mortgage transaction 
20 percent faster than 
their non-tech counterparts. 
Borrower defaults were significantly lower as well (38% lower for Federal 
HousingAdministration (FHA) 
purchase loans 
and 
29% 
for refinance 
originations). 
• 
A developing and unprecedented wave of housing demand: 
Several general 
housing 
market themes are 
helping to 
provide 
FinTech firms runway to disrupt 
the status quo. Since the fall of home prices from the peak, the pace 
of home 
sales has 
steadily risen and the inventory 
of homes for sale 
has fallen (Figure 
37). Some of this 
light supply 
is because 
single-family home 
building still 
lags in 
recovery (Figure 
38). This national 
trend of rising demand and falling supply has 
been 
supportive 
of home prices, 
which 
have appreciated at ~5.6% per year 
on 
average for the past four years. Stable, slowly rising home 
prices 
benefit these 
strategies because there is reasonable confidence asset prices won’t fall. And 
home ownership demand is likely to rise even more as the 
‘millennial’ 
generation 
enters the next stage of their lives, albeit later than previous 
generations (Figure 
39). And it’s important to remember that this wave of demand will be 
increasingly 
tech-friendly and will likely expect all transactions to happen 
quickly and 
efficiently.

So How Does It Work? 


In the 
traditional 
home sales 
model 
using an 
agent, the 
seller hires an 
agent who is 
responsible for marketing the 
home and attracting buyers. 
This 
process usually 
takes 2–3 months, during which time it is commonplace for the agent to conduct 
walk-throughs with prospective buyers.After an 
offer is received, the 
seller often 
has to wait for the borrower to 
finalize 
his or her 
financing to 
begin the closing 
process. At the end of this process, the seller pays 3%–6% of the 
sales 
proceeds as 
commission to the real estate 
agents. To 
get a sense of how much potential 
revenue exists in the 
space, existing home 
sale counts and 
median 
sale prices 
along with an assumed 5% of total 
market value amounted 
to ~$68 
billion in 2017 
potential commission revenue 
(Figure 
40). 


In contrast, the iBuyer model 
is a transition from the agent-based advisory system 
to a dealer-based 
system, where compensation is derived from a bid-ask 
spread 
rather than 
a commission. 
Specifically, the iBuyer firm will assess the value of the 
property and offer a bid to 
purchase the home 
from the 
seller at a 
discount. 
The 
iBuyer firm then relists the property and 
attempts to resell 
for full value, capturing 
the difference between the 
discounted 
acquisition price and the full value resale 
price as revenue. 

The value proposition to home sellers in 
the 
iBuyer model is the ability to move on 
a 
short and 
definite timeline 
that eliminates 
the 
stressful waiting game and 
inconvenience of showings and open houses. Additionally, by using advanced 
analytic techniques for valuation and the prime 
collateral 
status of vacant, 
move-in 
ready homes for financing, iBuyer firms believe it is possible for the 
discount to be 
comparable to the traditional commission amount. In 
other words, a seller could sell 
his 
or her 
home in a 
matter of a couple weeks with the same 
expected net proceeds 
as the traditional, multiple-month process. 


For buyers, the vacant state 
of the home allows for flexible move-in dates. 
Additionally, many iBuyer firms offer trial periods and warranties on core 
infrastructure 
that offer peace 
of mind. In the longer term, we expect the 
iBuyer 
firms to 
also 
build out mortgage origination businesses. Because the iBuyer firm will 
have already done a 
title search and 
an appraisal during the 
acquisition process, 
this 
could 
potentially be removed from the lending process due to redundancy 
— 
thereby lowering the cost and time to close.

In short, an iBuyer as 
central 
liquidity provider could 
better accommodate the needs 
of buyers and sellers independently than they are able 
to accommodate each 
other, 
all at a 
competitive cost. This should be 
surprising 
to those familiar with 
the financial 
markets, as ‘all-to-all’ 
markets 
are reserved for the most liquid and 
fungible assets, 
while illiquid and harder to value financial assets are the purview of dealers. 
Because residential real estate is retail, highly capital-intensive, and reliant on 
nuanced 
hyperlocal economic 
data, the 
market developed as an exception to this 
rule. But given the advancements in data availability and 
analysis as well as the 
trends in 
financial 
markets, we believe a reversion could be taking place. 


Other Follow-on Opportunities 


But the 
shift in business 
model does not and should not end 
with just buying 
and 
selling properties. 
There are differing 
strategies that take 
advantage of the 
holding 
period and unlock value by making nominal improvements/updates and repairs. 
Borrowers 
could 
find 
this attractive because the 
broker will likely have 
access to 
much cheaper financing 
to 
conduct these projects, and it can 
all be rolled into the 
borrower’s 
mortgage versus a 
higher-cost construction loan. Other strategies might 
involve offering additional 
services to 
a home 
buyer such as 
preferred vendor 
services like snow removal, landscaping, and HVAC maintenance (something akin 
to an 
online 
marketplace that shows you what other customers purchased). We also 
envision a 
joint venture strategy that works with home 
builders to 
help 
potential 
sellers 
effectively ‘trade in’ 
their old 
home for new construction. Finally, these 
companies 
might also align with the 
growing industry of institutional owners of rental 
properties, providing these real 
estate 
investment trusts (REITs) a supply of homes. 

What Are Barriers/Challenges? 


While these 
strategies 
are 
certainly poised to change the way 
we trade homes 
in 
the U.S. 
and abroad, there are several challenges and barriers to 
entry. First, 
a 
significant 
amount of capital is 
required to purchase, carry, repair, and 
sell homes. 
Second, this 
strategy also requires a reasonable amount of liquidity in 
a given 
housing 
market to confidently 
establish reliable 
home-price 
levels. And liquidity isn’t 
just by geography; liquidity could 
also 
be 
different by price 
point. 
These 
strategies 
may not work on, for example, the highest and 
lowest price points in a given area 
since liquidity is likely lower. There 
may be 
cases where the 
traditional broker model 
could co-exist 
alongside these liquidity providers, operating 
at the price tails. 

Additionally, the 
shifting age demographics of the U.S. might become 
a risk. 
Home 
prices 
may experience weakness 
as 
baby boomers 
move to 
either downsize their 
living 
situation by purchasing 
smaller homes or 
switching 
to renting. If 
millennials 
are either unwilling or unable to purchase these 
homes, there could 
be a 
scenario 
where home 
prices 
correct. Finally, regional expertise is still 
required to inspect and 
verify property pricing to protect against losses. 

Traditional Business 
Models to Change 


The stage is set. FinTech firms are 
positioning to upend the industry, 
and 
their 
innovations will likely produce 
winners and losers. Existing 
brokerage 
models 
that 
only collect advisory/commission fees will likely suffer as 
buyers and sellers 
are 
attracted to faster transaction times and potentially lower bid/ask 
spreads. Several 
of these 
legacy brokers have already announced small initiatives to adapt. Other 
companies 
that rely on broker advertising revenue 
could 
also suffer. 
We 
are already 
seeing home builders, real 
estate data providers, rental 
operators, mortgage 
lenders, and 
others 
starting to 
discuss the industry development in their public 
filings 
in a positive tone, and 
we 
expect existing 
FinTech players to take significant 
market share 
in the 
coming years as they shorten the timeline for buyers and 
sellers.
