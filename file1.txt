
Innovating in an Evolving 
World: 
Slow Change 
with 
Long-Term Impact 

Humans are hard-wired to respond to instantaneous 
change: Our ‘fight or flight’ 
response evolved to make snap decisions based on 
immediate danger. It is not in 
our nature to identify and react to challenges that arise slowly, even those with great 
long-term 
impact on 
our lives. 


Businesses face a 
similar problem when dealing with 
‘slow change’ 
in 
their 
industries. Large-scale societal, economic, and technological trends that emerge 
gradually and continuously over time can be 
all too easily 
overlooked. 
That is 
because 
‘slow change’ 
often occurs outside 
of an organization’s line-of-sight and 
can 
arise from the merger of many disparate 
developments, each of which may be 
lost in the day-to-day 
‘noise.’ 


Even the 
most forward-thinking companies can 
miss 
slow change 
occurring around 
them: 
In 2007, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said, “There 
is 
no chance the iPhone 
is going to 
get significant market share.”1 By neglecting 
steady, continuous 
advancements 
in 
computing power and mobile technology, Microsoft missed the 
smartphone phenomenon 
and 
saw its market capitalization 
fall from $642 
billion in 

2,3

2000 to $270 billion in 
2014.

In a time when the 
average 
company lifespan on 
the S&P 500 has dropped from 61 
years to 
18 years, spotting 
slow change is 
critical for long-term stability and growth.4 
At Citi, we track 
slow change 
by asking which 
trends are 
affecting our businesses 
and 
clients in ways that are 
both accelerating 
and 
irreversible. The results are 
evident in exponentially-improved systems 
that reduce friction or shift society in 
such a way that returning to 
the 
old practices seems inconceivable. 

By seeking 
out such patterns in our work at Citi, we have identified three types of 
change that often 
cause 
the 
biggest impact: 
(1) 
Behavioral 
changes, 
(2) 
Technological changes, 
and 
(3) Industry or sector changes. 


The most profound transformations incorporate at least one 
of these 
changes, but 
many 
often 
include 
more. Such is 
the 
case with three trends 
we are currently 
exploring: (1) changing 
social 
structures, 
(2) the 
changing nature of transactions, 
and (3) the 
changing nature of industries.
