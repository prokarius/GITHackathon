6. eSports 
The Rise of the 
Professional Gamers 


eSports (also 
known as electronic sports 
or professional video gaming) is a 
form of 
competition using video 
games. Most commonly, eSports take the form 
of 
organized, multiplayer video 
game 
competitions 
between professional players. 
Similar to traditional sporting events like 
the 
FIFAWorld Cup, sports fans 
get 
together to watch their favorite professional teams compete 
while several millions 
also tune in 
to watch 
a live 
stream 
or highlights 
of the 
event. 
These video game 
tournaments 
can 
be played 
across 
many devices including PCs, consoles, and 
tablets, though PCs are 
predominantly used 
in tournaments 
given their computing 
power and speed. Many genres of games 
exist that can be 
played during 
these 
tournaments 
including (1) 
First Person Shooter Games such 
as Halo 2, 
(2) 
Multiplayer Online Battle 
Arena (MOBA) games 
such as Dota 2 and League of 
Legends, 
(3) 
Strategy Games 
such as Starcraft, 
(4) 
Fighting 
Games, 
(5) 
Sports 
Games, 
and 
(5) Racing Games. The newest genre 
of eSports is 
Survivor Games 
like Fortnite Battle Royale and 
PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG).

eSports Evolution 


eSports has been around for some time, probably dating back to 
organized 
competitions in universities 
— 
Spacewar, Atari Space 
Invaders Championship, and 
Nintendo 
World Championships. The availability of high-speed 
Internet in homes 
and Internet cafes along 
with 
cheaper, 
more powerful personal computers have 
paved the way for video gamers to 
connect with one another to compete, compare 
scores, and 
share strategies. Free-to-play online spectator-friendly games then 
paved the way for the formation of fan bases who congregate 
to watch 
and 
cheer 
for their favorite players. In 2000, the first eSports association was founded 
in 
South 
Korea to promote and regulate eSports in the country given the 
tremendous 
popularity of StarCraft. In 
2002, as the player base expanded globally, Major 
League Gaming was formed to promote video 
games 
as 
a sport.

The average age of gamers has increased 
with 50% under the age of 35 vs. 75% back 
in 2003 

In 2011, 
Twitch, an 
online 
streaming service which allowed any players 
to broadcast 
their own gaming experience to the Internet at large, was launched. 
Twitch offered 
an avenue for engagement between the broadcaster and the 
audience via a 
chat 
window 
where fans 
could leave comments and connect with 
the players 
and 
each 
other. 
The first League of Legends 
and 
the International Dota 2 tournaments were 
held 
in 2011. In 2014, 
Amazon acquired 
Twitch for $970 
million in 
a cash 
deal 
to 
help 
drive 
its 
expansion 
into the digital distribution of gaming. 
YouTube Gaming was 
launched byAlphabet (Google) in 
2015. 

The age range 
of gamers is another important factor to consider. According to 
NVIDIA, in 2003 
75% 
of gamers were under 
the 
age or 35; 
today 50% of gamers 
are under 35. We are seeing 
a steady increase in 
the 
total addressable market 
(TAM) of overall 
gamers 
as younger generations 
enter the fray and older 
generations 
continue to 
game. 
We believe that this 
‘gamer for life’ 
phenomenon will 
translate well 
into 
growing 
eSports participants and audiences 
compared 
with 
more 
established sports leagues, 
which 
have a strong 
base of older generation viewers. 
Additionally, unlike 
traditional 
physically demanding 
sports, gamers 
can 
continue to 
game as 
they age, creating 
opportunity for larger tournaments. Given the infancy of 
eSports, however, professional gamers today tend 
to be younger than their 
traditional sporting 
peers.

Despite strong viewership vs. traditional 
sports, profitability and monetization have 
been challenging for eSports 

Monetization and Profitability Remain Key 
Challenges 


Despite the impressive growth stats listed above, profitability 
and 
monetization have 
been 
challenging for the 
eSports ecosystem. Newzoo estimates that in 2017 the 
eSports economy totaled 
$470 million, 
and 
it 
is predicted to grow to ~$1 
billion 
in 
2018.As 
impressive as that sounds, it pales when 
compared 
with 
traditional sports 
such as the NFL, 
which raked 
in $1.3 billion 
in 
sponsorship revenue in 2017 alone, 
with total revenues grossing 
over $13 
billion.

The creation of franchised structures could 
help the development of eSports 

Growing interest from media and telecom 
companies should also spur growth of the 
eSports economy 

One of the key challenges has been 
that eSports 
is 
still very much in its infancy 
compared 
with 
traditional 
sporting leagues 
that 
were founded almost 100 years ago. 
Therefore, we believe the industry is 
still refining the 
structure that will pave the way 
for 
improved 
monetization. Newzoo estimates that the average revenue per eSports 
enthusiast is ~$5.49, 
which 
pales when 
compared with $15–$50 per 
fan in revenues 
for traditional sports 
like basketball andAmerican football. 
The global 
nature of 
eSports games 
also 
makes it challenging to engage a local 
regional fan base while 
the 
ebb and flows in popularity of certain games/genres at any given point could 
shorten the duration span 
for making 
a return on investments, 
thereby demotivating 
significant sponsorship. 


One recent development has 
been the 
creation of a franchised structure 
similar to 
those of traditional 
sports leagues 
in the U.S. 
(i.e., 
the 
National Football League 
(NFL), National BasketballAssociation (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB)). 
Major game publishers Riot Games and Blizzard Entertainment have 
now started to 
operate the NorthAmerican League 
of Legends Championship and Overwatch 
League in a franchised 
structure with regional teams. 
This 
structure is helping to 
transform 
games 
into all-round entertainment franchises, attracting 
more 
gamers 
who may choose to adopt it as a career option. A franchised 
structure 
also offers 
greater certainty of the 
teams 
participating in the 
league 
each year, attracting 
investments from broadcasters and content buyers, sponsors, advertisers, 
and their 
agencies. The Overwatch League has 
now attracted investments 
from the 
likes of 
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, LA Rams owner Stan 
Kroenke, 
and 
others, each who have agreed to franchise fees of $20 million over the next few 
years. We believe 
this franchised structure will be replicated 
across 
other eSports 
game leagues domestically in 
NorthAmerica and could pave the way for uptake 
in 
other regions.Another example is 
that of the National BasketballAssociation, 
which 
is the first traditional 
sports league to have 
created an eSports partnership with 
Take 
Two Interactive Software. 

Another factor that we believe 
could spur the dollar growth of the 
eSports economy 
is 
growing interest from 
both 
media and telecom 
companies. With viewership 
of 
traditional sports waning, we expect the battle 
for 
content to increase 
over 
time, 
and 
media companies will want to 
become 
more involved in 
owning 
media rights 
to 
content. 
To this point, ESPN/ Disney and Blizzard Entertainment, the 
makers of the 
video game Overwatch, have recently signed a 
multi-year deal 
to 
broadcast the 
Overwatch League 
Grand Finals from 
the Barclays Center in New 
York.

They’ve also agreed to 
broadcast 
Season 2 
in 2019 
on ESPN, ESPN2, Disney XD, 
ABC, 
and 
streaming services for the 
term of the agreement. While ESPN has aired 
eSports events at other time 
slots before, this agreement marks the first time that 
live competitive 
gaming will be aired on ESPN in prime time 
and will be the first 
broadcast of an eSports championship onABC. This is also the first time a network 
has 
approved a 
multi-year agreement for eSports, airing an 
entire season of the 
games, and 
many are comparing this to agreements ESPN enjoys with other major 
sports leagues (i.e., the 
NBA). We note 
media rights (TV and digital) account for 
50%+ of the 
NFL's 
estimated revenues with FOX, ESPN/ABC, CBS, NBC, Direct 
TV etc., which 
pay an average of $7 
billion per year to 
air these games. TV media 
revenues have been 
a key driver for continuous NFL revenue growth from 
$4 billion 
in 2001 to ~$13 
billion 
in 2016. 
We expect 
TV deals similar to 
those 
announced 
by 
ESPN to continue to be 
a driving factor for the overall eSports ecosystem. 


These are 
just some of the factors in play. As the eSports industry evolves we 
expect to see 
significant development in the underlying infrastructure (player 
salaries, contracts, governance, college 
sponsorships, media deals) that can help 
improve 
the 
economics for the entire ecosystem. 


Winners/ Losers 


Despite the disruption eSports could 
cause to traditional sport viewership, there are 
groups that will benefit from its increasing 
popularity: 


• 
Media companies 
that 
have deep pockets 
and 
the 
overall audience reach 
to 
ensure they can 
get media rights to broadcast the 
content and maintain 
their 
ranking within their viewership 
base. 
• 
Large Internet companies that 
own specialized gaming channels with 
significant 
viewership and can demand 
large sums for rights to broadcasting 
content and 
advertising revenues. 
• 
Specialized hardware 
manufacturers such as gaming device OEMs, graphics 
processing 
unit (GPU) 
makers (86% 
of gamers use NVIDIAGeForce GPUs), 
high-end 
switch 
makers, and peripheral 
manufacturers 
(i.e., 
performance 
enhanced keyboards, mice, headsets, speakers, gamepad controllers 
like 
Logitech G gaming peripherals), as 
these 
have 
become necessary equipment for 
professional gamers as gaming content is becoming increasingly 
demanding. 
These brands are 
now sponsoring eSports teams. 
• 
Large 
game developers/publishers 
that 
can continue to leverage their current 
success 
across 
multiple genres to 
attract teams and fans to their games. 
On the other hand 
the 
following industries could 
see potential disruptions: 


• 
Traditional sport leagues and franchises as viewership and participation 
are 
diverted 
away towards gaming. One point to note is that even though 
the 
Super 
Bowl remains the largest TV attraction by far, viewership has 
been 
declining, 
with 
2018 viewership of ~103 million, down from its peak 
of 114 
million viewers in 
2015, according 
to Nielsen Media. 
• 
Sporting brands (e.g. athletic 
wear, athletic 
footwear, sporting goods 
stores) 
typically associated with traditional 
sports 
networks. 
• 
Media networks that are not traditionally associated with broadcasting eSports 
risk losing viewership and advertising revenues.
