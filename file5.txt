4. Big Data & Healthcare 
Electronification Begets the ‘So What’ Question 

The electronic health record 
initiative and increasing consumer buy-in on wearables 
has turned healthcare into a 
data problem. 

In 2013, at the onset of Meaningful Use, approximately 153 
exabytes of healthcare 
data were produced. Looking forward to 
2020, more than 
2,310 
exabytes of 
healthcare data are projected 
to be produced, creating a 
broad playing field 
for 
opportunities in 
these robust data sets. 


At the 
same time, rising 
costs in healthcare (~18% of GDP), an aging 
population, 
and the shortage of clinicians 
all 
create a 
need to 
monetize this 
data 
and 
bend the 
cost curve. 


We 
view opportunities in big data, artificial intelligence, 
and 
machine learning as the 
natural progression of healthcare’s newly formed data 
stores. 
McKinsey estimates 
these innovations 
could reduce healthcare 
spend by $300–$450 
billion. 
We 
explore 
the evolution of this trend, existing/potential future applications, barriers to 
adoption, 
and the winners/losers below. 

The Evolution of Data in Healthcare 


Although Electronic Health Records (EHRs) existed prior to 
2009, the 
majority of 
EHR sector growth was spurred by government intervention, with an approximately 
60 point uptick 
in 
penetration rates 
from the HITECH (Health 
Information 
Technology for Economic and 
Clinical Health) Act’s Meaningful Use program. 
The 
HITECHAct created financial incentives for provider adoption of EHRs, with the 
hope that electronifying healthcare 
data would help bend the ever-growing cost 
curve for healthcare 
spend in the United 
States. In effect, ‘you can’t manage what 
you can’t measure’ 
— 
so the first step from 
the 
government was a mandated 
measurement rollout. 


With EHR adoption 
now nearly universal (96% of hospitals and 87% 
of physicians 
reported usage of a certified EHR in 2015, as 
shown in 
Figure 
17 
and 
Figure 
18), 
we believe it is 
time to 
manage costs 
by driving actionable insights from 
the 
information 
captured. 
This 
desire is two pronged: Beyond the government objective 
of managing 
healthcare 
costs, clinicians are also 
looking to 
justify the value of these 
newly-electronified systems given high install/ownership 
cost.

Big data solutions are the next logical step 
to utilize the vast data pools 

Early data applications include analytics and 
population health as well as applications 
around patient and supply chain cost 

With these data stores now created, we believe 
big 
data solutions are the next 
logical step as a way to utilize 
these vast data 
pools, similar to what we’ve seen 
across 
other enterprise verticals. From 
a payer/provider standpoint, big data 
solutions also create 
a monetization opportunity in predictive analytics, improved 
diagnoses, 
and 
cost reduction. 


Early Data Applications in Analytics 


We 
are currently in the first wave of healthcare 
data utilization, with the 
healthcare 
information technology (IT) 
players cross-selling value-added solutions (often driven 
by their data 
stores) into their client bases. On the 
data-driven side, these solutions 
tend toward analytics and population health. 

Population health, or pop health, solutions entail quality/cost 
monitoring and 
management tools and all that goes with it, 
including 
data cleanup, care 
coordination, patient communication/engagement, 
and 
patient education. Pop 
health solutions can also include rudimentary predictive analytics tools, such as the 
evolution of a patient along the risk curve, but these tools 
tend to be early days 
compared 
with 
enterprise-facing big-data solutions. 


Specialized analytics applications, particularly around patient and 
supply chain cost, 
have been another key use 
of the new healthcare 
data stores. Unlike the 
predictive 
enterprise big-data analytics 
solutions today, these applications tend to be 
more 
backward-looking 
to help 
healthcare providers 
monitor and 
manage trends.

Defining: Big Data, AI, ML 

Big Data: Big data is a term that describes a 
large volume of data — 
both structured and 
unstructured — 
that traditional data vendors 
were unable to process. Today, big data 
refers to the use of predictive analytics to 
extract value from data. 

Artificial Intelligence: AI is the concept of 
machines being able to carry out tasks in a 
way that we would consider ‘smart’ 


Machine Learning: ML is a current 
application of AI based around the idea that 
we should be able to give machines access 
to data and let them learn for themselves 

The first wave of clinical support applications 
will help doctors make more robust data-
driven decisions in patient treatment 

A big data solution for interpreting a large 
store of x-rays can also function as a search 
engine for the diagnosis 

Machine-learning apps can leverage data 
across silos to increase the identification of 
disease risk 

Looking Forward: Big Data, Artificial Intelligence 
and 
Machine Learning 


Data Are 
Core to Healthcare; Big 
Data Are 
an Accelerator 


At their 
core, medical discoveries are often 
made by (1) observing associations, 
(2) 
creating 
hypotheses from these associations, 
and (3) hypothesis testing through 
clinical trials and real-world applications. 


We 
do not view big-data applications as a 
fundamental change to healthcare, but 
rather, an 
accelerator to this 
process. Given the vast stores of electronic 
data that 
have been created, this 
process 
can 
theoretically be fast-tracked through 
back-
testing 
large data sets. Opportunities 
from 
this process 
acceleration include 
more 
robust disease 
detection tools, predictive 
diagnosis capabilities, 
and decision 
support tools. 


Near Term Opportunity: Clinical 
Decision Support 


While we view predictive diagnosis as the Holy Grail solution 
for big data in 
healthcare, we expect this to be a longer-term opportunity given its layers of 
complexity. In the near 
to medium 
term, we see greater viability in decision support 
tools and, in certain applications, early disease 
detection. 

Clinical 
decision 
support tools 
entail 
any 
solution that provides clinicians with 
intelligently filtered patient-specific data at the appropriate 
time in the point of care 
to enhance decision-making 
in the 
clinical workflow. Ultimately, the first wave of 
clinical decision 
support applications will transform 
patient data from a pull to a push 
function 
at the point of care, helping doctors 
make more-robust data-driven 
decisions 
in 
patient treatment. 


Current Use Cases 


While we believe we are 
still 
in the 
early inning of widespread big-data 
applications 
within healthcare, some 
solutions 
are already in use today. We 
document a few of 
these use cases below. 


Radiology/Medical Imaging 


Certain 
functions 
in healthcare, like radiologists, are considered 
‘good’ 
once they 
have a certain level of experience 
seeing 
cases. However, a 
human can never see 
as many cases as an electronic database, making this an ideal application for big 
data/AI. Given 
a 
large enough 
store 
of electronified x-rays, the interpretation of an 
x-ray becomes 
a search problem, with a 
big-data 
solution functioning as a 
search 
engine for the 
diagnosis. 

Predictive Risk from Retinal Imaging 


The retina 
offers 
a snapshot of a patient’s vascular system, but the 
data 
are 
often 
under-utilized as 
they are 
siloed within ophthalmology practice EHRs. Recent 
machine-learning applications 
have 
leveraged this information to predict the risk 
of 
heart disease, with early trials 
showing a 
higher accuracy rating 
than 
the trial’s 
clinician 
evaluations. Although 
this 
solution has yet to be used in 
a clinical setting, 
we view this as a 
near-term 
opportunity that will create 
a quicker, easier, and 
lower-
friction (no blood test required) solution for evaluating a patient’s cardiovascular 
risk.

Cost reduction within the payments integrity 
and cost processing verticals is helped by 
machine learning and natural language 
processing 

Predictive analytics models can highlight 
issues such as transportation barriers that 
could lead to missed appointments 

Data siloing and usability issues within the 
healthcare sector as well as a slower shift to 
the cloud are potential barriers to quick 
adoption 

Claims Processing 


Early applications 
of machine learning and natural language 
processing 
are 
currently being 
used to reduce cost within the payments 
integrity and 
claims 
processing vertical. 
Traditional claims processing 
is 
a labor-intensive solution, 
entailing a 
clinician reviewing 
a complex claims document that often encompasses 
dozens 
of pages. With the use 
of robotic process 
automation 
(RPA) and natural 
language 
processing 
(NLP), payers are able to 
highlight the 
areas of significance 
within the 
claims document 
and 
increase the findings rate for errors without 
increasing 
headcount. 


Care Management 
Support 


Barriers 
in 
healthcare 
can extend beyond the core condition 
and treatment, such 
as 
access to 
care, transportation, and readmissions risk. 

Transportation 
is 
one 
of the largest barriers to care: low-income, elderly, 
and 
disabled patients 
miss ~24 
million appointments annually due to insufficient access 
to transportation. Further, no-show appointments 
due 
to transportation barriers 
alone represent ~$40 
billion 
in avoidable downstream costs 
and ~$4 
billion 
in lost 
revenue for doctors. 


Today, predictive analytics 
models can highlight patients at a higher risk 
of 
encountering 
transportation barriers 
by utilizing 
a patient’s socioeconomic 
data. For 
example, socioeconomic data 
might show that patients 
in a certain zip code 
are 
unlikely to have a car, alerting 
the care team 
to 
make arrangements for follow-up 
appointment transportation following a discharge, 
thus 
lowering 
downstream 
costs. 


Reducing readmissions is another focus of care 
management support teams, with 
predictive 
models aiding 
in the allocation 
of people, process, 
and technology 
resources. Beyond allocation, these predictive analytics 
can 
also assist a 
care team 
in time 
management, such 
as 
the frequency and intensity of follow-ups 
based on a 
patient’s projected degree 
of risk. 


Barriers to Adoption 
Looking at the 
Enterprise, It’s a Long Road Ahead 


Healthcare 
IT has historically 
mirrored the enterprise 
IT sector, albeit on 
a multi-year 
lag. Because 
of this, we look to the 
evolution 
of big data within the enterprise 
sector 
to frame our outlook for big-data adoption 
in healthcare. 


The rise 
of enterprise 
big data 
has 
gained 
momentum 
in recent years 
given the 
elasticity of the 
cloud 
and the 
dramatic reduction of computing and storage costs 
paired with significant gains in 
processing 
power. However, this opportunity in itself 
is still in 
the 
very early innings, with a significant focus on data cleanup and 
usability. This suggests 
a long 
road ahead for big 
data to truly penetrate 
the 
healthcare sector given similar data 
siloing/usability issues within the healthcare 
sector as well as a 
slower shift to the cloud. 


Additionally, healthcare IT faces several roadblocks 
that are 
unique to 
the 
space, 
given the competitive dynamics between the holders (and 
often times, vendors) of 
healthcare data. While 
in the 
near term, 
one of the biggest opportunities in 
enterprise big data is the consolidation/preparation 
of data for consumption by 
artificial intelligence and machine learning, this may get pushed off by healthcare IT 
vendors that are 
sensitive around releasing their data, which they view as key to 
their value.

Biggest roadblocks for widespread use of 
big data include lack of data standardization, 
siloing, lack of accessibility, the need for a 
clinical data warehouse, and privacy/security 
concerns 

The Evolution of Data Models 

1970s: The relational model (rows/columns) 
for data systems was introduced 

1980s: Data warehousing emerges 

1990s: Databases move off the mainframe 
into client / server models 

2000s: Rapid growth in data volume pushes 
traditional data vendors to the limit, creating 
the need for big-data technology and non-
relational databases 

Aggregation of data siloed across multiple 
verticals is a barrier 

Data Presents the Biggest Challenge 


As Eric Schmidt, former Executive Chairman 
of Google, 
noted in 
his 2018 HIMSS 
(Healthcare 
Information 
and Management Systems Society 
Conference) conference 
speech this past March, several steps are required 
in order for providers and 
healthcare 
IT vendors to make use 
of their newly electronified data. To pave a path 
to improved 
healthcare 
cost/outcomes, vendors need 
to (1) 
move healthcare data 
stores to the 
cloud, (2) de-silo 
the data to create robust data 
sets, and 
(3) ultimately 
apply machine-learning models to 
improve predictive analytics and diagnoses. 


Echoing Schmidt’s keynote, we believe the biggest roadblocks facing widespread 
use 
of big data for 
artificial intelligent/machine learning 
applications are (1) lack of 
data 
standardization, 
(2) the 
current siloing of medical data, 
(3) lack 
of accessibility, 

(4) need for a 
‘clinical 
data warehouse,’ 
and (5) privacy and security concerns. 
Data Issue 1: Cleanup 


The lack of standardization across 
healthcare 
data presents the largest initial 
challenge to adopting big-data solutions. 
The vast amount of data generated and 
collected by a multitude 
of agents in healthcare today come 
in many different forms, 
both 
structured and unstructured 
— 
from insurance claims to physician notes within 
the medical record, images from patient scans, conversations about health in social 
media, and information from wearables 
and 
other monitoring 
devices. 


For the most part, we believe 
healthcare data 
are 
compiled in SQL-based relational 
databases 
because 
these 
are 
well suited for discretely codified billing and 
clinical 
transactions data. However, this format presents limitations in both the volume and 
the 
velocity of data processing, while rapid growth in unstructured health data 
could 
create the need for hybrid (relational and NoSQL) databases. 


Further, the data-collecting 
community is equally heterogeneous, making the 
extraction and integration 
of the data 
a real 
challenge. Providers, payers, 
employers, disease-management companies, wellness facilities 
and 
programs, 
personalized-genetic-testing 
companies, social 
media, and patients themselves all 
collect data. Even 
standardizing for end 
market and form, the data 
standards 
presented in Meaningful Use 
were more open to interpretation than a 
standardized 
protocol, creating a 
lack of standardization even across EHR systems. Integration of 
data will require collaboration 
and leadership from 
both 
the 
public and private 
sectors. 


Data Issue 2: 
Siloing 


Medical data 
are 
spread 
across many sources governed 
by different states, 
hospitals, and 
administrative departments and information 
silos exist across both 
private and public 
sectors. Even within organizations themselves, multiple 
sources 
of data 
— 
such as clinical, financial, and operational data 
— 
are kept separated. 
The issue is further compounded by each data 
system’s unique key identifiers, 
validation rules, and format. With medical data siloed in a 
multitude of verticals, the 
result is difficulty in data 
aggregation when attempting to 
create a 
complete data 
set 
to analyze a patient or a population. The integration of these 
data 
sources would 
require developing a 
new infrastructure where 
all 
data providers collaborate with 
each other.

Data sharing and accessibility is limited 

FHIR creates a standard for different data 
elements to build APIs for use on datasets 
from different systems 

Finding a place to warehouse the huge 
amount of data in healthcare is a challenge 

Safeguarding data is key and heightens the 
cost of data vs. other industries 

Data Issue 3: 
Accessibility 


Stemming from the siloing of medical data, the ability to create full data 
sets for one 
patient or a population to work with is limited 
by the 
lack of accessibility across 
different source of data.According 
to an athenahealth 
survey, while 79% of doctors 
believe that having all available patient data in 
one 
place 
is 
critical to their jobs, only 
14% 
could access EMR information across different departments, patient care 
centers, etc., even within the same 
hospital. While recent regulation looks to 
improve 
upon data sharing, our channel checks 
have shown vendor hesitation and 
proactive friction in data 
sharing. 


In order to 
increase 
interoperability among hospitals, physicians, and 
other relevant 
parties, the industry is slowly shifting to a new technology known as FHIR (Faster 
Healthcare 
Interoperability Resources). FHIR creates 
standards for different data 
elements so that developers 
can build 
application programming interfaces (APIs) 
that can 
be used to access datasets from different systems. 


Data Issue 4: Warehousing 


Assuming the data get standardized 
and 
become de-siloed and accessible for use, 
the challenge standing in the 
way is the need for a 
clinical data warehouse to host 
the 
vast amount of data (projected 
data size 
2,310 exabytes 
by 2020). Only once 
this 
data 
are 
curated 
into usable data sets can they 
then 
be used for sophisticated 
analysis with a richAPI. 
The data warehouse would require two tiers of data, with 
the first tier being primary data stores 
sourced 
from EHRs, supplemented by a 
second tier comprising 
unstructured data 
collected from everywhere else. 


Data Issue 5: 
Privacy/Security 


Given the enormity of total population 
medical data both 
in 
value and volume, large 
data 
stores are at a high risk of tampering and theft. 
This is particularly vital as a 
leak of identified health data is irreversible, unlike the leaking of a 
more 
dynamic 
data asset such as a 
consumer’s credit card information. 


This security risk necessitates 
significant investments to 
safeguard the 
data, 
creating 
a heightened level of cost compared 
with 
other industries. Privacy 
concerns have 
also led to slower momentum 
in 
data 
storage 
evolution, with locally 
hosted systems 
still prevalent 
within healthcare 
due to perceived cloud risk.

Big data providers should benefit from 
selling solutions to healthcare providers and 
existing healthcare IT vendors 

Existing EHR players will also benefit as 
their data stores are difficult to replicate 

Source: Citi Research 

Winners: 
Big 
Data Vendors, Healthcare Data Owners 


We 
segment the winners of big data in 
healthcare 
into two core groupings: the 
providers of the big 
data 
solutions, and 
the 
players that own the healthcare data 
(shown in 
Figure 
19). 


On the big-data provider side, winners 
will include the established technology 
players, the 
big 
data vendors, and the existing healthcare ITplayers 
that take a 
forward-looking 
approach to 
big-data, machine-learning, 
and 
artificial intelligence 
solutions development. 
These 
vendors will 
benefit 
from 
selling solutions into 
both 
healthcare providers 
and 
the 
existing healthcare 
IT vendors that are looking to 
bolster their solution sets via outsourced R&D. 


On the 
healthcare-data owners side, we view the most likely 
winners as the existing 
EHR players and, potentially, large 
cloud-computing entrants from the technology 
side. We believe the data 
stores created by the EHR players are not only the 
most 
comprehensive but that they will be difficult to replicate 
given 
their creation via 
government intervention. 
Regarding 
the large cloud-computing entrants, we have 
seen a greater push by these 
players 
to enter the healthcare vertical, creating 
large 
de-siloed stores of data. 
These players will be the 
best positioned to create saleable 
solutions from their data stores as well as 
in selling 
de-identified 
data 
to 
solutions 
vendors 
in need 
of a robust data set. 


Losers: 
Less Impact, Pressure on Manual Processes 


As big data applications, and even healthcare IT itself, are both newly created 
fields, displacement risks 
from this trend 
are more narrow. Near term, big-data, 
machine-learning, 
and artificial intelligence 
solutions 
could 
create downward 
pressure 
on pockets of employment 
in the 
medical field, such as radiology and 
claims processing analysts. 

However, given the 
intersection of increasing 
life expectancy and the declining 
supply of doctors, we believe these solutions are 
more likely 
to supplement than 
displace clinicians. We view these tools as a way to improve 
clinician 
productivity, 
especially in the 
early days of predictive analytics: 
Big data 
solutions will be viewed 
as decision support, if not the 
ultimate decision 
maker.
